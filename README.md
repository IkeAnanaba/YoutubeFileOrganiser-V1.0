# YoutubeFileOrganiser-V1.0
A little program I wrote that would help me organise my Youtube projects into files that can be saved in an organised manner so I never lose my files again.


  Unfortunately, the database was designed in a way that it is only useable on the desktop in which the MySQL database was created so to use this particular code, one will have to set up the database on their own device with exactly the same design. I do not think this is necessary and I will rectify this in the next version.
